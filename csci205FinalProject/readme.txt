Overview:


The idea itself is quite simple: we have created a Bucknell themed Monopoly.  In order to run our program, run the “MonopolyMain.java” file within our group’s folder.  Once this is run, an input window will pop up prompting the user to enter four player names.  The game that we have created is played with four human players at one computer.  Once the names are inputted, click “Play”, and the user statistics at the bottom of the window will be updated.  Throughout the game these will continuously be updated with each turn.  The player statistics include the current bank account, whether the player is in jail, the current space, and the properties that the player owns.


Look up to the upper right hand side of the screen to see which player’s turn it is.  At the beginning of the player’s turn, the player has the option to click the “Check for Monopolies” button.  This will inform the user if there are any available monopolies that they own, and will allow the user to build houses on a property they choose, and thus increment the price.  The user only has the option to “Check for Monopolies” at the beginning of their turn.  Once the player would like to begin their turn, click “Roll Dice”, and the player will be taking through a series of popup windows.  The first will be how many spaces they have rolled, then the information of the space they have landed on.  You can assume that this games plays exactly like a real Monopoly game.  Properties allow the player to either purchase or pay rent, Chance gives a card with an outcome, Tax spaces deduct tax, Go To Jail sends a player to jail, once in jail a player must roll doubles to leave in the first three turns and so on.  The player can see their progress based on their dot on the board. 


When a player becomes bankrupt, their bank account gets frozen at zero.  When it comes time for the bankrupt player’s turn, they will get an error message when they try to roll the dice, and the game will continue on to the next player’s turn.  In order to end the game, click “End Game”, and the winner of the game (whoever has the most money in their bank account) will be displayed.  Overall, we have included pretty much every aspect of a normal Monopoly game (excluding mortgaging properties).
